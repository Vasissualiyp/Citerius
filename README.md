In order to make script work, in ~/env/venv python environment the following packages should be installed:
* pybibget
* arxiv
* pyfzf
* pybtex
* ads (not yet implemented, should scrape NASA database)

### Todo:
* ADS python package: https://ads.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
* Before searching online for arxiv number, instead search local dir (not to double-download)
* Implement search not only with arxiv number, but title, year, author, etc.
* Integration with Noterius
* Refactor into separate scripts
* vim plugin
