In order to make script work, in ~/env/venv python environment the following packages should be installed:
* pybibget
* arxiv

### Todo:
* Before searching online for arxiv number, instead search local dir (not to double-download)
* Implement search not only with arxiv number, but title, year, author, etc.
* Latex source download
* From source download, be able to extract images and equations
* Integration with Noterius
